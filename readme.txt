Notably, most of the functions are from Favaretto et al. (2022), thanks to them!

1. "eval_LEs_DFC_OPS.m" --- to organize data
2. "main_DFSs.m" --- to get indices of DFS, including state ratio, dwelling time, and transition probability
3. "Get_all_state_index.m" --- to organize DFS indices for further statistical analysis
4. "Q_RM_LM.m" --- to calculate the Q value between the cerebrum and the cerebellum
5."Shift_Hubs_lhh.m" --- to obtain hubs. However, before running this code, please run Gretna manually to get network indices, including Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Nodal Efficiency.
